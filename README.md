Overview
SignSense Detection System is designed to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired community by recognizing sign language gestures in real-time. The system utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for training and OpenCV for video capture and processing.

Features
- Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets sign language gestures from live video feed.
- LSTM Model: Uses a robust LSTM model to handle the sequential nature of sign language.
- OpenCV Integration: Leverages OpenCV for efficient video capture and preprocessing.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple to use with clear instructions and an intuitive interface.

Installation
To set up the SignSense Detection System, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SignSense-Detection-System.git cd SignSense-Detection-System

- Install dependencies and other files for importation purposes:
1. !pip install tensorflow opencv-python mediapipe sklearn matplotlib = for jupyter notebook
2. %pip install tensorflow opencv-python mediapipe sklearn matplotlib = for VScode
3. Ensure you have OpenCV installed: pip install opencv-python
4. Download pre-trained model (if available): LSTM Model
5. import cv2
6. import numpy as np
7. import os.
8. from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
9. import time
10. import mediapipe as mp(for vscode you have to downl;oad it)

Usage
Run the application:
python main.py

Instructions:

- Ensure your webcam is connected and properly configured.
- The system will start capturing video and recognizing gestures in real-time.
- Detected gestures will be displayed on the screen.
- Model Training
   To train your own LSTM model, follow these steps:
- Prepare your dataset: Organize your sign language gesture videos into appropriate training and testing directories.
